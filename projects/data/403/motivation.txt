<p>The whole point of this project is to make a robot spherical in shape. Because this shape is the most versatile and it has very good  maneuverability.</p><p>If given sufficient power it can tackle any terrain. The main selling point for this bot is that it does not have any default  orientation like most of the other bots do, so even if it is overturned there  will be no problem. The applications are too many. For example we can use it to explore  forest terrains, planetary exploration , and every elsewhere where the terrain is unpredictable. We can automate it to explore and provide us with important data like topography ,</p><p>visuals ,etc of the entire location.</p>
