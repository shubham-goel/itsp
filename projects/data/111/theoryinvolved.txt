<li>Image processing</li></ul><p>Using MATLAB software we are going to detect the finger movement over the piano keys through colour detection (as particular colour will be there on finger tips).The webcam over the piano we get the input and corresponding sound will be played.

<li>Including sound files</li></ul><p>For getting the right sound corredponding to particular piano key we recorded sound(sa re ga ma pa dha ni Sa ma' re_ ga_ dha_ ni_ ) and put them in our code according to their designated key on piano.</p><ul>
<li>Making piano keys</li></ul><p>We use the principle of dispersion to convert laser point into a straight line.We use a scale in an appropriate position in front of laser .the space between two adjacent straight linr will denote a piano key.</p><ul>
<li>Mechanical structure</li></ul><p>We use wood to make our final model as it is light weight,portable and easy to deal with during designing process.It includes three wooden planks ( two for fitting lasers and one for fitting webcame),one thick long woodem plank (for attaching other wooden planks in appropriate position ) and two small wooden planks at base to make the strucure stable.</p>
