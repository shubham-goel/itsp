<ul><li>our approach for object sensing.</li></ul><p>we have used ultrasonic sensors connected to arduino for sensing objects around us. after a certain time interval the device sends ultrasonic waves to all three sides which are reflected by the objects around it. these waves are then sensed by the sensor and the time difference between sending the waves and their sensing is calculated. now the distance is given by the formula distance = duration/58.2</p><ul><li>our approach for aim determi8nation.</li></ul><p>to determine thye aim we have used an IR sensor.  we ahve put a servo motor on the top of the bot and ir sensor attached to it. during each loop it rotates nits maximu  angle and then tells the  direction in which the aim is present . may it be left or right. </p><ul><li>our approach for next action.</li></ul><p>once we have got the direction of the aim then it becomes the preffered direction and whenever it gets space in that direction it turns into that. </p><p><strong>once we have got the distance for all three directions then we after checking for preffered space if object is in front then  takes a move  in the direction where space is available. if space is available in forward direction the it moves forward otherwise it takes a turn depending on the space available. if no space is available anywhere then it moves backward.</strong></p><ul><li><strong></strong>parameters</li></ul><p>we have used 15 cm as critical forward distance and 15 as the minimum turning side distance.since it after each distance calculation it takes a few miliseconds calculate the distance next time so 15 is the maximum distance it could move in the time.</p><pre><br></pre>
