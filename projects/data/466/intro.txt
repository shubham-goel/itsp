<p>There are a lot robotics bots being made every year under various projects everywhere. Each of them has a different control strategy. Some of them uses voice recognisation , internet based control or remote controlled , gesture controlled etc. the basic idea used is to transfer the electric  signals required by a bot to some other form which have been mentioned above. So all of them just do some modification in the input. </p><p>So we thought it would be a nice idea to make a bot which does not requires any kind of input. This puts an end to all kinds to signalling inputs given by human. we tried to make a bot which drives itself. AN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING BOT. This is our project in  which  we made a bot  which drives itself.</p>
