<div>There are basically two parts of the projects. First of all we had to make a model that detects objects around it. the second part included programming to produce a response according to the situation. This also includes destination specification as the direction of movement will on that. The basic concepts have been describes below -</div><ul>
<li>First of all we need a bot which gives us control over its direction of motion and speed.  for that we used the XLR8 type model of the bot and differential mechanism for turning.</li><li>next we determined the surrounding of the bot because as humans our driving depends on the surrounding objects. this was done using the ultrasonic sensors.</li><li>next part includes mapping the destination . as it self driving so it should know what is its destination. </li></ul>
