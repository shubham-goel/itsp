<p>ELECTRONIC APPROACH-</p><p><em><strong>Here we will show you the parts of the circuits we have used. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The first part of the circuit was to convert the signal given by arduino into something useful for the motors. As we have used  4  motors and arduino cannot drive motors so we have used a mapping circuit for this part. this circuit takes the arduino output as a signal and transfers the voltage given to it to the motors. we have used L293d for this task. The circuit diagram is given below.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/3a_JezUGUCm3GO0cJW_1LuvtHaQTY90jbhl_jhVnwpsff15p5gXxub-uKVE8ePUbQ_lNhA=s170"></p><p><em><strong></strong></em></p><p><em><strong></strong></em></p><p><a href="http://stab-iitb.org/wiki/File:L293xlr.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://stab-iitb.org/wiki/File:L293xlr.jpg"></a></p><p>in this diagram we have given the 12 volts from a battery and the input from arduino. whenever the input is high then the 12 volts is transferred to the output on that side. and the current drawn from the input is very small so this circuit is used to drive the motors using the  arduino.</p><p><em>The next part was the object sensing part.  For this we have used three ultrasonic sensors</em>. the circuit used is shown below.</p><p><img src="http://www.engineersgarage.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/Original/wysiwyg_imageupload/1/Ultrasonic-Sensors3.gif"></p><p>the arduino is the control circuit for us. after a fixed time interval it sends ultrasonic waves which are detected by the sensor and trhe time difference tells the distance of the object.</p><p>the next part is the mapping part. for that we have used IR sensors. after each loop we rotate IR sensors all round the angle using servo motor. the direction from which get signals is the direction in which aim is situated.</p><p>MECHANICAL APPROACH-</p><p>for the mechanical design we have used differential mechanism in the bot. there are 4 motors each controlling a wheel. the motors for one side wheels are connected in parallel. this ensures that the wheels on one side rotate with same speed. whenever we require to turn in any direction we just reverse the voltage polarity in that direction and the bot rotates on its axis in that direction. for the part above the chessy we have covered have laid the circuit on the chessy and then it has been covered by acrylic sheet. there is the servo motor lying on the top of all which detects the aim.</p><p><em><strong></strong></em></p>
