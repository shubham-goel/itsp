We came up with two ideas :</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">1st METHOD : Using Infrared</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">We create an IR plane using an IR laser diode with a line cap  and use an IR camera to see the IR plane. The user keeps his hands in a cupped manner and hence his fingers cut through the IR plane creating bright spots/blobs which the camera sees and the motion of these blobs is translated into cursor movement. Again index finger does left click and middle finger ,right click .</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><br></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2nd method : Using pressure</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Its like we wear pressure gauge sensors on our fingers (index and middle) when we place our fingers on a surface the pressure sensor under the finger detects some pressure. The pressure is converted to electrical signals/RF and transmitted to the computer  . If we move our finger in this stage(both the fingers must have nearly same pressure for the cursor to move) the cursor moves . When we lift our finger the pressure decreases and when we place back the finger the pressure increases bak to about the previous value. If this happens within 2secs it is translated into a click.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The 1st method seems simple but requires a lot of image processing and the problem is how we detect a particular finger like index finger for left click and so on</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The problem with the pressure idea is how will we move the cursor. </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3rd and Final method : using red laser line</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">We couldn't get the infrared laser diode so we took a red laser diode with a line cap which illuminates our fingers and the light disappears when we lift our finger for a click. This could be used for clicking purpose but for tracking. The problem we faced here was in tracking the illuminated fingers as didn't appear red completely and were reddish white we could not find a threshold for this colour in matlab.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"> </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong></strong></p>
