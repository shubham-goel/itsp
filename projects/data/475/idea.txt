<p>Sound Follower uses the following concepts to achieve the desired goal:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) -</strong> The analog signals from a source are received by mics and is converted to digital signals which are used by MATLAB to process it further.</li><li><strong>Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-</strong> The digital signals are stored in a form of discrete valued array of numbers. These arrays can be manipulated with to produce a desired analog output.</li><li><strong>Time Difference Of Arrival method (TDOA) -</strong> Sound source localization is performed by calculating the time delay in arrival of sound waves to the two sound detectors (mics). </li></ul>
