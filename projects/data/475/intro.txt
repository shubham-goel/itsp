<p style="text-align: justify;">Sensor Robots have always been an area of immense interest for the electronics and robotics section. However when the sensing is based on the analysis of the delay between two signals, the task becomes more challenging. This project is an attempt to use ordinary equipment in extra-ordinary ways to achieve sound source localization in a 2-D plane with a good accuracy and precision. This project also demonstrates how to use an unbelievably versatile machine (laptop) for a very specified task, without indulging into the technicalities of the machine. The workload flows from the detectors(mics) to processor(MatLab) to controller(Arduino Uno) and finally to servo motors that control the pointer to source, verifying the result.</p>
