<p>First we make a basic model for testing purpose </p><p>Initially we will work on following part using sharp sensor(IR sensor) . We have checked its reading in daylight and also in night to observe the effect of IR radiation from sun , and we observe that there is not much difference between them and it perfectly work for straight but the problem with sharp sensor is its range is too small and region which it cover in one reading is very small  which gives trouble in surveillance . So we search for a new sensor and then we come up with HC-SR04 ultrasonic sound sensor which has enough range , very good accuracy along with enough surveillance power . First we check sensor working and then start designing the the final model along with search for voice recognition module.</p><p>Initially we think of using easy VR shield 2.0 which is easy to work with and it can also carry more number of commands at a time but the problem with that is it's cost out of the maximum allowed range so then we come down to VR module V2(visha electroronics)</p><p>First we coded the VR and then recorded the voice commands and check its functioning and then we do the mechanical stuff . We make chassis by using acrylic sheet by cutting it into desirable shape , then we use large L clamps to elevate it and look like a pet , after that adding motors and wheels . Now we place battery , arduino , pcb , VR module and sensor mounted over a servo motor on chassis and fix them .<br>After assembly we need to recheck our codes and debug it if any error appears .</p>
