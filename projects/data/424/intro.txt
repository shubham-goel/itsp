<p>We had planned to make a tilt rotor RC plane which will have two modes hover mode and rc mode. The basic idea of the project was to tilt the motors of the plane to achieve the thrust in different directions. The motors would be vertical in the hover mode which would lift the plane up and then the motors would tilt so that the direction of thrust would be in forward direction and then the plane would be like any other simple rc plane.</p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/0.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/1.jpg" style="width: 255px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" alt=""></p><p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e7QNbU71lsA/3.jpg" style="width: 251px;"></p>
