<p>In order to achieve the goal of this project the work has been categorised as follows:</p><p>
• Study of Arduino Uno </p><p>• Study of Ultrasonic Sensors</p><p>
• Incorporation of audio in SD card flash memory</p><p>
• Designing of the stick </p><p>Basic principle :-</p><p>Proximity Detection
An object passing anywhere within the preset range will be detected and generate an output
signal. The detect point is independent of target size, material, or degree of reflectivity.</p><p> Ranging Measurement</p><p>
Precise distance(s) of an object moving to and from the sensor are measured via time intervals
between transmitted and reflected bursts of ultrasonic sound.. The distance change is continuously
calculated and respective result is outputted.</p>
