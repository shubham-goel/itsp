These motors are connected to the receiver which controls the angles of these motors. When the plane has to go straight both ailerons and the elevator are in the same plane as the wings and tail. When the plane has to turn left, the left aileron rises upwards and the right one drops downwards. This decreases the lift on the left aileron and increases it on the right one thus producing a torque which makes it roll to the left. Similarly, when the plane has to turn right, the right aileron rises up and the left one drops down. When the plane has to rise upwards the elevator moves upwards, decreasing the force on the tail thus moving upwards (the plane will be tilted upwards) and when the plane has to move downwards, it drops downwards.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><inline style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></inline></span></p><ul><li><strong>Working of the remote or the RC transmitter:</strong></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 40px;">The RC<strong> </strong>tran<strong>s</strong>mitter has different switches (or channels) for different controls like throttle, elevator etc. When we use the remote to send signals to the plane, it generates and transmits a PPM signal which is received and converted to a PWM signal by the receiver present on the plane. This PWM signal controls the motors and servos.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p>
