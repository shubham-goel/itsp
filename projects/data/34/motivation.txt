<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The motivation for our project is to make transportation
between small to medium distances such as the distance between our hostels to
the academic area faster, eco-friendly and portable. Letâ€™s face it would you
rather prefer walking to a Monday morning class or skating to it. Cycles and
ordinary roller skates are not portable. aYou need to park your cycle in a cycle
stand which may not be exactly where you want to be going whereas ordinary
roller-blades are bulky and you cannot carry them along with you. The solution
to the problem is quite simple. You take the shoe away from the ordinary
roller-blade leaving the framework, wheels, axle intact and attach a few straps
to the sides so that your footwear can be attached firmly to the framework
thereby making the rollerblade lighter, detachable and easier to carry. As most
novice skaters have some difficulties in braking, an additional feature in our
project is that we will be having hand-controlled braking.</em></p>
