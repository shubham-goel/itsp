Theoretically our project is similar to a roller-blade the
only difference being the braking system.<br>

We have short-listed on 2 braking systems which are as
follows-<br>

1)Disc brake mechanism- It uses the same mechanism as used
by bikes. On pressing a button on the remote-control held in our hands, brake
pads press onto the disc which will be attached to the back-wheel of our skates
mounted on the same axle as the wheels slowing the speed of rotation of the
wheels without causing much wear and tear to the wheels. This can be achieved
both wired and wirelessly. Wired mechanism is the same as that of a bike. To
make it wireless we need to broadcast Bluetooth signals when we press the
button on the hand-held controller which will be received by the brake pads and
causes them to press against the disc.<br><p>

2) The cycle brake mechanism- It uses exactly the same
mechanism as used in cycles. On pressing a button on our controller, brake pads
present on the wheels will press against the wheels, slowing the speed of rotation.
This will be easier to make but will cause more damage to the wheels because of
wear and tear. Even this can be achieved both wired and wirelessly in a
mechanism similar to the disc brake mechanism as discussed above. </p>
