<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>These skates have basically the very strong plastic base made up of polyurethane with wheels attached to it in inline way.</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>
1)plastic frame and rubber sole- the plastic frame would have the rubber sole attached to it with the two straps in the front.the straps would ensure that the shoes of the skater are held very tightly to the skates.again the rubber sole would help in better fitting as it is a bit flexible.</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>
2)ankle support-there are two ways in which we can put ankle support.they can be either wore separately after wearing skates .or in other way the base of the anklet support can be attached permanently to the rubber sole of of our skates and to be wore with them only. </strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3)brakes-this is the most important feature of our skates.we have friction brakes attached to it for  better control over the skates.the idea is to attach breaking system to the last wheel.friction brakes means basically similar to that used in bicycle where when we press brakes the wire contract and it comes in contact with wheels leading to loss of kinetic energy due to friction.control of the brakes would be in the hands of skater to be controlled mechanically only.</strong></p>
