<ul><li>How is the copter flight explained ? ?</li></ul><p><strong>LIFTING MECHANISM </strong>: When the propellers rotate the downward air creates a thrust to opposite drag force and thus lift is generated.</p><p><strong>TURNING MECHANISM:</strong> For the quad to bent to one side i.e the roll of the quad is achieved by increasing the motor speed of one and decreasing spped by same magnitude of the other.</p><p><br>PITCHING MECHANISM: For the quad to pitch forward or backward, same mechanism of roll can be used except the motors active now are the other two.</p><p><br>YAW MECHANISM: Yaw is the rotation of the copter about itself about its z-axis. This is achieved by increasing speed of two diagonally opposite motors and decreasing by the same magnitude the speed of other two. As each motor rotates, it creates a torque about the centre.For the quad to be with zero yaw, two diagonally rotate in clockwise and other in countet clockwise direction thus balancing the torque.<br>LET US CONSIDER THAT ALL THE ABOVE ARE TO BE DONE AT THE SAME HEIGHT. SO THE TOTAL LIFT HAS TO CONSTANT.</p><p>SO AT ANY TIME THE SUM OF ALL FOUR MOTORS HAS TO BE CONSTANT.</p><ul><li>HOW TO MAKE THE MOTOR SPEEDS CHANGE ? ?</li></ul><p>FOR VARYING THE SPEEDS WE USE ESCs (ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER). So, the command given from transmitter will trigger signals to ESCs .</p><p>FOR THIS WE NEED A FLIGHT CONTROLLER.</p><ul><li>WHAT HELP DOES FLIGHT CONTROLLER DO ? ?</li></ul><p>Flight controller is the combination of sensor and gyroscope.</p><p>It primarily has two functions: a) to transmit signals to ESC s as per the commend of transmitter.b) to process the inputs from gyroscope and stabilize the flight by sensors.</p><ul><li>BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO ALL FOUR MOTORS BY A PDB.</li><li>RECEIVER IS CONNECTED TO FLIGHT CONTROLLER .</li></ul><p>TO SUM IT UP: </p><ul><li>The propellers rotate when motors attached to it rotate.</li><li>The propellers provide the thrust to lift the copter.</li><li>The movement of the copter can be controlled by certain speed changes in the rotation of motors.</li><li>The command given by the transmitter alters the  speed of motors suitably.</li><li>For this the receiver controls the four motors by ESC(Electronic Speed Controller) through a Flight Controller Board.</li></ul><p>FOR THE FRAME HAS THE MAXIMUM WEIGHT DESIGN AN OPTIMAL STRONG AND LIGHT FRAME OF APPROPRIATE THICKNESS.</p><ul><li>THE SAFETY RATIO OF THRUST : WIEGHT IS 2:1.
