<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>Planned about procedure and components required.</li><li>Studied the physics behind the flight of copter.</li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li>Placed the order with<em> Hobbyking.</em></li><li>Designed various frames and finalized the optimal one of aluminium and got it laser cut at Bhandup.</li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>Received the order and frame was ready.</li><li>Meanwhile also understood the working of flight controller.<br></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>Testing of the flight controller was done and code was uploaded on the controller.</li><li>Assembly of other components like ESCs, Battery, PDB, etc was done on the frame.</li></ul><br><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul><li>PID values of the controller were calibrated.</li><li>The connections of receiver and flight controller were done and the copter was tested for first time.</li><li>The copter had a constant yaw around itself which had to be rectified.</li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the settings on the transmitter and the PID values again.</li><li>Found that the alignment of rotation of propellers was not right.</li><li>Successfully flew the copter to a descent height .</li></ul><h3></h3>
