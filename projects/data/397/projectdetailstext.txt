<h3><strong>Our Project involved both electronics and coding</strong></h3><p>The coding part in our project involved making the Android App to control the bot and the coding for the electronics in the bot itself. The electronics also involved basic wiring and powering for the servos.</p><p>The code for the arduino involved the implementation of the gait for the bot using Inverse Kinematics and the control of the servos obtained by them.</p><p>The android code is to control the bot and its movement.</p><p>The code is uploaded on a google drive the link to which is-</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4pRtPje1ae3T3FLSlV6UWhTQXc&amp;usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4pRtPje1a...</a></p><p>We decided to make the parts of the bot using acrylic sheets and connecting all the said parts with nuts and bolts. The legs any arthropod have 3 parts, the coxa, the femur and the tibia. With a bit of intelligent design, we managed to do away with the coxa and hence require only two parts, the fwmur and the tibia. The servos for the fore end of the femur were housed in a bracket that was supported by the base itself. On the other hand, the tibia had a cut out in it so that it could contain the joint servo in itself.</p><p>The electronics of the bot was kept (or joined to) the top of the base from where all the connections to the servos were made with male-male jumper cables. To facilitate the easy connection and removal of the jumper cables, we used floor solders on the PCB which gave us female jacks for the male - male jumper cables.Since the Arduino board also has female jacks, making the connections became a matter of simply inserting the male-male cables.</p><p>Although we used the TowerPro MG995 servos, I would not recommend these servos to anyone else. The batch given to us was extremely glitchy and did not work as servos are expected to work. This forced us to change our approach several times during the project. The Futaba servo, however performed very well and was just as one would expect.</p><p><img src="http://www.singahobby.com/files/images/S3003.jpg"></p><p>Futaba S3003 Servo with size specifications and the circular head attachment that we used.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.instructables.com/FG9/MBMW/H5TUB41V/FG9MBMWH5TUB41V.MEDIUM.jpg"></p><p>ToerPro MG995 Servo with all the accompanying attachments.
