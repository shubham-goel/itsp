<ul><li>The main theory involved is in the use of inverse kinematics to generate the gait of the bot.</li><li>Inverse kinematics(IK) refers to the use of the kinematics equations of a robot to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired position of the end-effector. Specification of the movement of a robot so that its end-effector achieves a desired task is known as motion planning. Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint actuator trajectories for the robot.In our project, we have used Leg IK to determine the angles between the coxa, tibia and femur parts of each leg. The changes in the angles in turn change the position and orientation of the legs. By making the legs mimick the actual motions during the walking of a hexapod, and repeating these motions periodically, we can determine the gait for the walking of the hexapod. This gait can then be implemented by setting the servos to appropriate angles, and making them repeat this motion periodically. The values of the angles can be found out by inverse kinematic analysis for the systeM i.e. by using the trigonometric relations between the three parts of the leg.Most often, hexapods are controlled by gaits, which allow the robot to move forward, turn, and perhaps side-step. Some of the most common gaits are as follows:Alternating tripod: 3 legs on the ground at a time.Quadruped.Crawl: move just one leg at a time.Gaits for hexapods are often stable, even in slightly rocky and uneven terrain.</li><li>We decided to implement gaits (tripedal) for walking forwards, backwards and turning clockwise on the same spot.</li><li>The theory also involved the knowledge of how to use servos.</li><li>Servos have 3 wires, a signal wire, a power wire and a ground wire. In our case, for the MG995 the following colour specifications were under consideration - yellow wire (signal), orange (power) and brown (ground). For the Futaba S3003, the colour scheme was slightly different. White(Control), Red(Power) and Black(Ground).</li></ul>
