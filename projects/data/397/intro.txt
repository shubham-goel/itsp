<p>Biology inspires engineering of all forms. The inspiration for the rough terrain octopod is the spider. Spiders are incredibly versatile movers that can jump, climb walls, swing across crevices and walk in a fashion that is quite different from that of humans. Emulating all the motions of a spider will be quite difficult so we have decided to go for a simpler version which will take into account the basic motion of the spider and translate to the motion of our bot. If time permits, we will also look into some of the advanced moves of the spider.</p><p>The aim of the project is to replicate biological behaviour using mechanical and electrical engineering in the simplest way possible.</p>
