<p><inline style="color: rgb(227, 108, 9);">Our project is about making a spherical mobile robot which can be controlled using a bluetooth application. Spherical robot is the most preferred design due 
to its easy maneuverability, holonomic nature, 
omnidirectional movement. As a result the robot can 
navigate around any object easily and the chance of getting 
stuck in corners is reduced. Due to its shape there is no 
question of overturning as often found in case of 
traditional wheeled robots. This feature also allows them to 
be thrown or dropped. A spherical robot would 
be appropriate for many different mobile robotics 
applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, 
hazardous environment assessment, search and rescue, as 
well as planetary exploration.</inline></p><p><img src="http://www.technologyreview.com/files/81304/Sphero_x900.jpg"></p>
