<p><inline style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">While searching for feasible projects we could undertake,we came across the idea of spherical mobile robot. It seemed to be an excellent source of entertainment apart from having a plenty of other applications.Due to its spherical shape, it can travel across rough terrains and inaccessible places and hence can be used for surveillance, search and rescue operations. Spherical mobile robot with an inserted camera can also be used for wildlife photography.All these benefits of the sphero prompted us to undertake this project. We even plan , if possible, in the future, to upgrade it to an obstacle detecting robot.</inline>    </p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3iekwuScLmg?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
