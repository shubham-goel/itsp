<p>further abstract:-we will try to make more appropriate design.</p><p style="margin-left: 100px;">then we will add camera for using tricopter for capturing photos and videos.</p><p style="margin-left: 100px;">we will add gps tracker to track the tricopter.</p><p>A tricopter has three rotors in which  two rotors that are spinning in opposite directions but there is a rotor left who produces torque that tries to spin the tricopter. Because of this, tricopters are usually using a rear servo to tilt the rear rotor to compensate this torque in the same manner a helicopter tail rotor does. The advantage of this solution is more yawing agility in comparison to multicopters with even amounts of rotors.</p>
