<li><span style="color: rgb(151, 72, 6);">OBSTACLE DETECTION</span> : First thing required for avoiding an obstacle successfully is to detect that obstacle. We will be using ultrasonic transmitters and receivers to do the same. We will measure the time required for the ultrasonic waves sent from the bot to echo back from the obstacle . So the distance of the nearest point of the obstacle will be given by formula <strong><span style="background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70); font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">DISTANCE = (SPEED OF SOUND IN AIR AT ROOM TEMP. ) X (ROUND TRIP DELAY)/2</span></strong></li><li><span style="color: rgb(227, 108, 9);">AVOIDING OBSTACLE: </span> After knowing the position of obstacles the bot will be able to choose an obstacle free path to avoid that obstacle.</li><li><span style="color: rgb(227, 108, 9);">RADAR: <inline style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We will be using serial signalling to transmit signals from ultrasonic sensors to computer which with the help of processing will show the distance of nearest obstacle at each degree.</inline></span> </li></ul>
