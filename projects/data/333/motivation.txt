<p>Our inspiration for the project are BATS . </p><p>Bats detect obstacles and prey by using Ultra Sonic Sound . While travelling bats emit ultrasonic sound waves . these waves are echoed back from obstacle or prey depending on intensity of reflected sound and the time required for the sound to return they determine weather prey or obstacle is present and its distance.</p><p>In short we are trying to mimic bats in our bot.</p><iframe width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vRHaFQo6fmk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong><br></strong></p>
