<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/rishab%20more/Desktop/bot.jpg">             The word robotics is used collectively to define a field in engineering that covers mimicking various biological characteristics.</p><p>             There are two types of robots : A) Robots that act as we give signals remotely</p><p>                                                                             B) Robots that are self-thinking and take their own decisions</p><p>              Autonomous robots are nothing but self thinking robots that can make decisions themselves with the aid of programmed brain present with them without any human guidance.</p><p>              Our aim is to make an autonomous robot that can detect obstacles in its path followed by avoiding them successfully.</p><p>We also have made an radar prototype along with this bot just to gain some knowledge of a software called processing.</p>
