<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul>
<li>Plan the project by looking at similar projects made;  get ideas from them and improvise upon them.
<ul>
<li>List out the components needed and make a rough budget.  Decide which material to use to make the arm. Make a Lamington visit and get the components.</li><li>Make a pen and paper draft of the model.<br>

<li>Accomplished
<ul>
<li>Decided to have 1 degree of freedom in the wrist, and 3 degrees of freedom in the elbow. Decided to use an android app instead of using accelerometer + magnetometer in order to accommodate the yaw movement in the elbow.</li><li>Decided to use transparent acrylic to make the body of the arm, and plastic to make the palm.</li><li>Thumb mechanism put off for later. Decided to use four 2kg servos for the the fingers ( all excluding the thumb), two 3 kg servos for the wrist and the rotational degree of freedom in the elbow, and two 6 kg servos for the other two degrees of freedom in the elbow.</li><li>Decided to use linear sliding potentiometers to move the fingers.</li><li>Made a Lamington visit and got the necessary components.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Get the rough sketch of the servo brackets to be used done on paper, and determine the dimensions. </li><li>Start work on coding part.</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul>
<li>Decided on the design of the brackets to be made. We could either make it by the manual way or use a 3D printer. Due to various reasons we decided to make it in the conventional way in the end.</li><li>Checked the working of servos by using Sweep code in the Arduino.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:
<ul>
<li>To be ready with the motor brackets.</li><li>To code for the servos.</li><li>To think about the mechanism of the thumb.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved<ul></ul></li><li>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</li></ul><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Find out a better method to get the co-ordinates of the LED's. Do testing the find out the problems.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Found out a much better way of getting the centres of the LED's and differentiating them. Very good results from the testing. Recognised the problems. Working on solving them</p><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Complete the programme for 2 cameras. Find out possible bugs</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Completed the programme. There are some bugs. Bit of flickering is there. Also some angles arent detected properly.</p><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:</li></ul><p>Sort out the bugs. Prepare video, posters etc.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished? : Tell us what you are up to.</li></ul>
