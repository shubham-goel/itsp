<ul><li>Our approach for image processing:</li></ul><p>Opencv-</p><p>This the best open source software available for fast motion tracking. The concept involved behind the tracking was the conversion of an RGB image ino an HSV one.</p><p>This is followed by filtering the image for a paricular colour using its HSV values(or intervals). The Thresholded image contained only the required colour as white spot and rest of the image is black.</p><ul>
<li>Optimising the colour tracking:</li></ul><p>This is achieved by the simple method of 'erode and dilate' the thresholded image. Eroding diminishes the white colour pixels therby removing small noise. This is followed by Dilate which increases the size of remaining white pixels thus sharpening the tracked object and thus a decent tracking is achieved.</p><ul>
<li> Getting the coordinates:</li></ul><p>Coordinates are calculated using the moments method of calculation. Its just some simle maths.</p><ul>
<li>Driving the bot  given the coordinates:</li></ul><p>This was achieved using wiringPi library which provided the required outpus in the GPIO pins of R-Pi according to the coordinates present.</p><p>New coordintes are provided each time the screen is refreshed thus making the bot to move towards the object in small steps.</p>
