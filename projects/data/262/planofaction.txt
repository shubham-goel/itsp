<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>Planned</li><li>Accomplished<ul><li>Write here what have you accomplished</li><li>You could anything you like</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>Start work on the model with only front camera.</li><li>Build the mathematical model.</li><li>Start work on the main code</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>Mathematical model ready. Given the positions of the LED's, we can now find the individual anlges of each joint.</li><li>Main code ready. Testing to be done.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?:<ul><li>Do testing on the one camera model.</li><li>Start to link the second camera with the programme.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What we achieved<ul><li>Completed multiple testings on the programme. Basic tracking achieved. Optimisation required. Working on finding better ways to find the co-ordinates of the centre of LED. Right now we are picking up the pixels with maximum Red, green or blue content. However this is giving poor results.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Find out a better method to get the co-ordinates of the LED's. Do testing the find out the problems.</p><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Found out a much better way of getting the centres of the LED's and differentiating them. Very good results from the testing. Recognised the problems. Working on solving them</p><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Complete the programme for 2 cameras. Find out possible bugs</p><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Completed the programme. There are some bugs. Bit of flickering is there. Also some angles arent detected properly.</p><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?:</li></ul><p>Sort out the bugs. Prepare video, posters etc.</p><ul><li>What you have accomplished? : Tell us what you are up to.</li></ul>
