<li>Our Approach <strong>to Image Processing</strong></li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The input image obtained from the IR camera is subjected to background subtraction using inbuilt class of OpenCV BackgroundSubtractorMOG2, and function bg_model(Mat, Mat, bool). This image after background subtraction is convverted to grayscale, and is then thresholded using appropriate value of threshold.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><ul>
<li>Mouse Movement : -</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">For detecting the movement of the finger, contours(blobs) are detected in the thresholded image using findContours(Mat, vector&lt;vector&lt;Point&gt; &gt;, vector&lt;Vec4i&gt;, int, int, Point). This function returns a vector containing the information of all the blobs in the image. This vector is then sortedin the decreasing order of area and then the 0th index of that vector is taken to get the required blob. The centroid of this blob is calculated using moments. The movement of the centre of mass is used to control the movement of the cursor.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><ul>
<li>Click : -</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Left click can be done by tapping and right click can be done by tapping two fingers(middle and index). When the user lifts the finger for tapping, the number of blank frames between lifting the finger and tapping are counted. If the number of empty frames are greater then 0 and less than equal to 4, then a click is done. If one finger is tapped then left click is done and if two fingers are tapped then right click is done.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><ul><li>C++ program to Ubuntu OS</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;">The mouse movement and click information is sent from the C++ program to the Operating System(Ubuntu in our case) using the xdotool library.</p>
