<p>This proect aims to create a mechanical model of the popular snakes and ladders game. Here the pieces move on their own, using magnets. Stepper motors drive two parallel rails beneath the board and a perpendicular rail atached on top of it, thus allowing to cover the whole x-y plane.  Their motion is controlled through the arduino which receives its input from the  computer system.  A strong magnet from beneath the board attracts a small magnet on top of the board. A rectangular motion from the initial to final position is achieved.</p>
