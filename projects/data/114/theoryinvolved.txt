<div><p><strong>MOTORS</strong><br> We used 6 wire unipolar stepper motors for the x and y axes. Unipolar steppers are useful for low speed, high torque applications. Sequential energising of coils within the motor allow the motor to move in clockwise/anti-clockwise direction, in precise steps. The uln2003 ic, which is a darlington transistor array felicitates this sequential energising of coils. The motion of the motors is used to acheive any coordinates on the x-y plane.</p><p>Arduino - An arduino duemilanove was used as the microcontroller for the setup. Digital pins on the arduino control the amount of current flowing out, as required by the code and move the steppers the required number of steps.</p></div><div><strong>Rack and Pinion mechanism </strong> : Rack and pinion mechanism converts the rotational motion of the motors into linear motion along the rails. This was used to achieve linear motion along the x as well as y axis.<br></div><p><br><strong>Slider Rails</strong><br>A set of drawer bearings were used to rest the motors. These have small  ball bearings, which allows them to slide smoothly. While the gear moved along the rack, the motor could also slide upon these rails, with minimum effort. A perpendicular sliding rail was attached on top of two parallel sliding rails to cover the whole plane.   <br><strong></strong></p><p>While moving from one player to another, we need to detach the magnet from the magnet above. This was accomplished using a servo motor. The motor is attached to the magnet beneath. It rotates from the vertical to a horizontal position, detaching the two magnets.</p>
