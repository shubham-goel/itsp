<h3>Week 1 (May 20th -27th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Get some basic knowledge of all the terms regarding aeromodeeling</li><li>Decide the size of the plane..... and make 2 dimensional wing on the choosen software.<br><p><img src="http://www.stab-iitb.org/resources/images/f/f7/Logical_structure.png" style="width: 513px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" alt=""></p></li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>Accomplished
<ul>
<li>Learn terms like Cl,Cd,Angle of attack(alpha).ec..,</li><li>Designed the 2 dimensional wing </li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 28th- June 4th )</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Start work on the model with only front camera.</li><li>Build the mathematical model.</li><li>Start work on the main code</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Mathematical model ready. Given the positions of the LED's, we can now find the individual anlges of each joint.</li><li>Main code ready. Testing to be done.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (June 5th - June 12th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:
<ul>
<li>Do testing on the one camera model.</li><li>Start to link the second camera with the programme.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved
<ul>
<li>Completed multiple testings on the programme. Basic tracking achieved. Optimisation required. Working on finding better ways to find the co-ordinates of the centre of LED. Right now we are picking up the pixels with maximum Red, green or blue content. However this is giving poor results.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (June 13th - June 20th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Find out a better method to get the co-ordinates of the LED's. Do testing the find out the problems.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Found out a much better way of getting the centres of the LED's and differentiating them. Very good results from the testing. Recognised the problems. Working on solving them</p><h3>Week 5 (June 21st - June 28th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Complete the programme for 2 cameras. Find out possible bugs</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Completed the programme. There are some bugs. Bit of flickering is there. Also some angles arent detected properly.</p><h3>Week 6 (June 29th - July 5th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:</li></ul><p>Sort out the bugs. Prepare video, posters etc.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished? : Tell us what you are up to.</li></ul>
