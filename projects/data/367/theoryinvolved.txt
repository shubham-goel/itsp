<li><strong>Measuring
Airspeed using pitot tubes:</strong><br><p>We decided
to use a differential pressure transducer to find the difference in total and
static pressure across the plane.  </p><p>A pitot tube
will be protruding through the nose of the plane which gives the total
pressure. The other will be vertical through the fuselage, giving the static
pressure. These two will be connected to the two inlets of the pressure sensor
which outputs their difference.</p><p>If
d=density, v=airspeed;</p><p>0.5*d*v<sup>2</sup>=
total pressure – static pressure</p><p>From above,
we calculate airspeed v.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p></li><li><strong>Measuring
Altitude and Temperature:</strong><br><p>For
altitude, we use a sensitive Barometric Pressure Sensor. We can calibrate
altitude according to variation in barometric pressure. </p><p>A lot of
Barometric Pressure sensors also are inbuilt to measure temperatures.</p></li></ul><ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong></li></ul><p><strong></strong>We use an Arduino (Uno, here) to gather the data from these
sensors and print it to an SD Card in-flight, using an SD Card Shield. After
the flight lands, the SD Card is removed and the Data read, which will be
stored as “.csv” file.</p><p> The Pressure Sensor is an analog sensor, so we connect it
one of the analog inputs of the Arduino.</p><p>The BMP085 uses I2C interface, so it’s pins are connected
to the respective pins on the Arduino.</p><p>The SD Card Shield uses SPI Interface, and is connected to
Digital pins 8~13.</p><p>The Arduino
program is written in C language.</p>
