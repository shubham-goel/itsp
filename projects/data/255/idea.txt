	<li><strong>Gesture recognition</strong></li></ul><p>
	For gesture recognition , the input will be taken from the accelerometer as acceleration values along the 3 axes . These values will be processed and detected in Arduino IDE and then  will be passed to Processing which will use these values in the game</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Wireless communication</strong></li></ul><p>For separating the sensor  from the circuitry we will be using Xbee modules to communicate wirelessly between sensor and the laptop.</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Processing  </strong></li></ul><p>Processing is an extremely powerful language for designing games and a lot of options for graphics. A simple model of DX ball game was first made for the basic level of the project.</p>
