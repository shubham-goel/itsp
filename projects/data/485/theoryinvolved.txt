<div><strong><br></strong><p><u>LOGICAL OVERVIEW</u></p><p>We needed to do the following major tasks to complete the
project: -</p><ul>
<li>To Build a single neuron  (Either a McCulloch Pitt model or an analogue
model like the Harmon Model) 
</li><li>To create a neural network of some sort from
these neurons (of a feasible size for a practical application) </li><li>Find an application for our neural network and
implement it successfully.</li></ul><p>The first part was quite easy and we completed the circuits
of both the models on bread-boards quite comfortably.</p><p>The major problem that we had with the construction of a
neural network using TLUâ€™s was to find a mechanism that could dynamically
change the weights and find the optimum weights on its own. We came up with the
solution that we could use digipot ICs (digital potentiometers) which are
essentially variable resistors that can change their values in a programmable
way.  However, these ICs were not
available in the market which forced us to complete the design using mechanical
pots.  </p><p>The next challenge was to find a suitable application for
these neurons. </p><p>As we had attempted to make line followers in our first semester
using an Arduino microcontroller, we decided to make a line follower with these
neurons doing away with the need for a microcontroller, since it seemed like an
ideal application requiring only 2 neurons. </p></div>
