	<u>INTRODUCTION</u></p><ul>
	<li>·We got the idea for this project from the
introductory courses on biology and electronics we had in the second semester. 
	</li>	<li>·We researched the topic further and came to the
conclusion that 
	<strong><em>artificial neural networks</em></strong> would be far more interesting to
model rather than single neurons due to a large number of practical
applications and lots of reference material to read further. It seems that most
of the literature related to neural networks deals with computer modelling
rather than hardware, although hardware implementations have been realised. 
	</li>	<li>·We understood the basic element of all neural
networks called the Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) or the McCulloch Pitt's Neuron
and how it works. We also understood how some analog models of neurons worked,
specifically the 
	<strong><em>Harmon Model.</em></strong></li>	<li>·We implemented the Harmon Model on a bread-board
to achieve the action potential curves. Also, we completed the McCulloch Pitt's
Neuron on a bread-board using an adder and a comparator.
	</li>	<li>· The next
step was to find a suitable application for our simplistic neuron model, and we
came up with the idea to make a line follower using these neurons.
