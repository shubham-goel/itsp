<h3><p style="margin-left: 440px;"><u>TECHNICAL OVERVIEW</u></p><pre>The Harmon Model’s circuit diagram can be seen from the references.
We implemented the circuit using BJTs on a bread-board, supplied the input
pulses from a 555 timer and measured the output using an oscilloscope.</pre><pre>For the McCulloch-Pitts model, on the breadboard we used a
741 op-amp as an inverting adder and the same as a comparator. However, the 741
requires a dual supply of +-15V which we did not have, so we used the LM324
op-amp for our line follower. Also, for the LM324 we used a non-inverting adder
rather than an inverting one.</pre><pre>The following was the adder circuit that we used, modifying
it to have six inputs at the + terminal while V<sub>3</sub> was grounded and no
other inputs were supplies to the – terminal. The 100k resistors at the inputs
were replaced by 100k pots.</pre><pre>We used the following circuit as a comparator with
hysteresis, the output of the adder going in at V<sub>REF</sub>, and the
threshold voltage at V<sub>IN</sub>. We also used pots to achieve a variable
threshold to be supplied to the comparator.</pre><pre>We chose V<sub>CC</sub>=12V for the LM-324.Since the IC
cannot drive a motor, the output is passed to IC7805 and then to the motor
driver IC L-293D.  </pre><p><img width="319" height="154" src="file:///C:/Users/vishrant/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_5"></p><pre>Thus, the adder and comparator completed our neurons for the
line follower.</pre><pre>We also explored the programming of neural networks on
computers for simulation to some extent in MATLAB as well as C++.</pre><pre>We built two 6 input McCulloch-Pitts neurons on a PCB, one
to control the left motor and the other for the right motor. We used 6 IR LEDs
as our inputs and the weights were implemented using mechanical pots which were
rotated by us during the training process to achieve the right combination such
that the bot could follow a line.</pre><pre>Finding the right weighing mechanism was our biggest problem
throughout the project, we tried all possibilities such as simulating the
neurons on a computer to find the weights and then just placing these weights
on a circuit to programming digital potentiometers to find the optimum weights
on their own.  </pre><pre>Major difficulties faced were that of putting together all
components on a PCB, soldering and unavailability of digipots. Debugging the
circuit took up a lot of time and effort as did the training process.</pre></h3>
