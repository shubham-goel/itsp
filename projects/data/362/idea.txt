<li><strong>Capturing the live video of the person from the webcam by using image acquisition toolbox of MATLAB, and then initialising the videoplayer.</strong></li><li><strong>Using the CascadeObjectDetector function of computer vision toolbox which uses the Viola-Jones algorithm to detect face, eyes or nose of a person's image, here we are using the function of detecting the eyes.</strong></li><li><strong>Cropping the eye part image and then thresholding it.</strong></li><li><strong>Use of Erosion algorithm to remove the noises from the output image.</strong></li><li><strong>Eventually two types of output images are obtained, one complete black which is represents the 'Eye closed' state and one with black background and two white spots(the pupil of the eye) which represents the 'eye open' state.</strong></li></ul><p>Then a audio file is played or stopped using these two output images as an input.</p><p>
