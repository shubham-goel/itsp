<p style="margin-left: 20px;">I(Rohit) had seen a similar kind of technology developed by a group of students in the event 'yojna' in Techfest 2014. They had built a device which was connected to a cellphone, that takes the person's eye blinks as an input to control the cellphone. Detection of eye blinks is quite a challenge, we accepted it and aimed at controlling a device using eye blinks as an input.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">If developed well, this technology can be used well for paralysed people who can't control their hands to control things they just through their eyes.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><iframe width="660" height="415" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ReN2l816L8k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
