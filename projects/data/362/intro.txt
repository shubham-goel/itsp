<p>This project aimed at developing a technology that could help paralysed people or people who have lost their hands or can't use them to control a gadget such as a music player.</p><p>But due to unavoidable circumstances, only one member of us could work on the project and so at present we have developed the base for the project and not the complete thing we aimed for.</p><p> Through the ideologies and source code developed in MATLAB, a person can play, pause, resume or stop a soundtrack by his eye blinks. The input device used is the default webcam of a laptop, </p><p>it captures the person's video frame by frame, and the MATLAB code processes the frames one by one to eventually give two distinguished images for 'eye closed' and 'eye opened' state of the person. The same code then works accordingly to whether play or stop a soundtrack.</p><p>Here you need to write the documentation of your project Which will include your project details..<br>You may include pictures , videos anything using this editor</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/10155858_775603745785905_954071363_n.png"></p>
