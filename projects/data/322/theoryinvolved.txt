<div>We are making a android controlled quadcopter. we are using accelerometer and gyroscope sensor of android phone and  bluetooth module for communication between android and arduino , PID for stability control. For proper fly without spninning we have to rotate 2 pair of apposite moters in deffrent  direction as shown in picture.</div><p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <img src="http://creativentechno.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/quadcopter_x_flight_dynamics_yaw_pitch_roll.jpg"></p><div>  Accelerometer measures acceleration of device due to applied force,   gyroscope measures angular velocity .</div><div>ARDUINO</div><div>                   Arduino is an open sourse electronics prototyping platform based on flexible ,easy to use  hardware and software . Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino Programming Language  and the Arduino development environment .</div><div>P.I.D</div><div>A <strong>proportional-integral-derivative controller</strong> (<strong>PID controller</strong>) is a <u>control loop feedback  mechanism</u> . A PID controller calculates an <em>error</em> value as the difference between a measured <u>process variable</u> and a desired <u>setpoint</u>. The controller attempts to minimize the <em>error</em> by adjusting the process through use of a manipulated variable.</div><div>I.M.U</div><div> Inertial measurement unit contains gyroscope and accelerometer . Which is most crucial part of P.I.D control system.</div>
