<p>We have tried to make a study lamp which can be adjusted in its azimuthal angle, height and brightness by hand gestures which are captured by a camera and processed by OpenCV libraries in C++ language. The movements of the lamp are controlled by two DC motors which changes the angle of the boom in space just like theta and phi on spherical coordinate system. The data processed on laptop is sent to an Arduino board placed in the model, which controls the rotation of the two motors. As far as the brightness is concerned we have used photo-diodes and their variable resistances are picked by Arduino which in turn control the LED matrix..</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/10155858_775603745785905_954071363_n.png"></p>
