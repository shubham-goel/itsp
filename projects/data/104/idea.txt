</ol><p><strong>1.  IMAGE PROCESSING</strong></p><p>We are using the OpenCV libraries on the Ubuntu platform for the purpose of image processing. We will take the video input from a camera and then use the color detection to create a specific set of commands for the bot.The commands thus generated will be written on the serial port by manipulating the parameters of '/dev' file.</p><p><strong>2.  WIRELESS COMMUNICATION</strong></p><p>The commands thus generated using the OpenCV program will be transferred to the Arduino mounted on the bot by using the xbee wireless module.One xbee(transmitter) will be connected to the laptop and the other(receiver) will be mounted on the bot connected to the arduino to receive the commands.Then the bot will move accordingly.</p><p><strong>3.  ARDUINO</strong></p><p>We will be using the arduino programs to act as an interface between the commands generated by the C++ program and the commands that will be given to the bot.</p><p><strong>4.  GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI)</strong></p><p>We have created a graphical interface to make it easy for the user to access our application. We have used Python language and Qt4-designer in Ubuntu to create the application.</p>
