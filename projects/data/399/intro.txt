<p>Our ITSP project is an android application which allows multiple users to chat through WiFi direct. There is no need of net pack as our app uses the WiFi network created by the phones itself. Our app will be able to transmit the message, even if the receiver is outside the direct range of sender. The message will be relayed through other user in between them.</p><p><img style="width: 733px; opacity: 0.5;" src="http://ciid.dk/root_ciidwww/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/06-interview-via-facebook-chat-on-mobile-1024x768.jpg" id="irc_mi" height="433" width="577"></p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://ciid.dk/root_ciidwww/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/06-interview-via-facebook-chat-on-mobile-1024x768.jpg"></a></p>
