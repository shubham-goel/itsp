<h3>Week 1 (May 18th -25th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Plan1 For week 1 :</li><li> Overview of the whole Project</li><li>Roughly Listing Out the components We would need</li><li>To make a list of Soft Skills we would need<br><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p></li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>Accomplished<p><img src="http://www.prairiehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PH5-CTS-15.jpg" style="width: 443px; float: right; opacity: 0.5;" alt=""></p></li><li>We went through the project Idea,found out that these soft skills are necessary</li><li>SOLIDWORKS</li><li>MATLAB</li><li>AVR PROGRAMMING / ARDUINO</li><li>We then knew about the essential sensor we will be using (MPU-6050)</li><li>We are now in a position to visualize the working of the Bike </li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Start work on the model with only front camera.</li><li>Build the mathematical model.</li><li>Start work on the main code</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Mathematical model ready. Given the positions of the LED's, we can now find the individual anlges of each joint.</li><li>Main code ready. Testing to be done.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:
<ul>
<li>Do testing on the one camera model.</li><li>Start to link the second camera with the programme.</li></ul></li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved
<ul>
<li>Completed multiple testings on the programme. Basic tracking achieved. Optimisation required. Working on finding better ways to find the co-ordinates of the centre of LED. Right now we are picking up the pixels with maximum Red, green or blue content. However this is giving poor results.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Find out a better method to get the co-ordinates of the LED's. Do testing the find out the problems.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Found out a much better way of getting the centres of the LED's and differentiating them. Very good results from the testing. Recognised the problems. Working on solving them</p><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?</li></ul><p>Complete the programme for 2 cameras. Find out possible bugs</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Completed the programme. There are some bugs. Bit of flickering is there. Also some angles arent detected properly.</p><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul>
<li>What you have planned ?:</li></ul><p>Sort out the bugs. Prepare video, posters etc.</p><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished? : Tell us what you are up to.</li></ul>
