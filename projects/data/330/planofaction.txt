<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>Plan for week1</li><li>
<p> we planned to learn things what we need to do our project</p></li><li>
<p>aurduino coding</p></li><li>
<p>bascis of android programming</p></li><li>
<p>basics of html,cssdecide the parts required to construct bot.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Accomplished<ul><li>able to use aurduino effectively</li><li>still learning basics of aurduino</li><li>decided all the parts required</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>starting android programming</li><li>Build the mathematical model of bot.</li><li>Start work on the main code of aurduino</li><li>to buy all the required parts.</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>Mathematical model ready. Given the positions of the wheels, we can now find the speed of individual wheel to move the bot in given angle.</li><li>Main code of aurduino is almost completed.</li><li>android app's user interface is made.</li><li>bought all the parts and chassis is made for bot.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?: 
<ul>
<li>completing aurduino code.</li><li>interfacing bluetooth module with aurduino</li><li>completing construction of bot </li><li>working on android app</li></ul><ul>
<li>What we achieved</li><li>completed aurduino code .</li><li>learnt interfacing bluetooth module with aurduino</li><li>completed construction of bot.</li><li>did some work on android app</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li><li>making a web page</li><li>debugging aurduino code</li><li>completing android app</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li><li>just made a webpage using html,css</li><li>aurduino code is perfect</li><li>android app is almost completed</li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li><li>Learn php,xml</li><li>making android app as a connection between webserver and aurduino</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li><li>learnt some coding in php.. and tried for few days to achieve  what we have planned...<br>but due to some reasons We've have to leave earlier..so we thought of completing the bot that can be contolled using mobile.<br>(we worked a bit harder but we can't make it to bot that can be controlled using internet)</li><li>finally, we have completed  a bot that can be controlled using an android mobile.</li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?:</li><li>nothing</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished? : </li><li>nothing</li></ul>
