<p><strong>Image Processing:-</strong></p><ol><li><strong></strong>Preprocessing Image:-</li></ol><p style="margin-left: 20px;">It is necessary to preprocess the image before it is used for text detection. Preprocessing involves following main steps:-</p><ul><li>Converting to grayscale and binarization:-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           By converting image to grayscale, since text is usually with high contrast with respect to backgraound, it makes the text clear. In binary image we give some threshold for a pixel value to convert the pixel into either black or white.</li><li>Adaptive threshold:- In case of adaptive threshold each pixel gets different threshold depending upon its neighbourhood. Gaussian threshold calculates weighted mean of surrounding pixels and makes it threshold of pixel. Adaptive threshold improves clarity of text.                                                                                                                                                      </li></ul><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b style="font-size: 14px;">2.  Detecting text:-</b></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">If image includes text only, then one has to find only a black pixel from surplus of white pixels. It will help to find text.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, if the text is hidden in an image with some natural scene, then Stroke Width Transform is used.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">Link about SWT- <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/text_detection.pdf" style="font-size: 14px;">SWT link</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b style="font-size: 14px;">3.  Recognizing text:-</b></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">While recognizing text, neural network or histograms are used. In neural network, a network is formed from artificial neurons which is nothing but a code that further connects to other neurons. It uses some sample text and converts sample images into binary image and then to some n x n array containing only 0 and 1. Then the detected text is cropped and send to this network. Neural network extracts letters from image and converts it to same n x n array. Then by comparing two arrays, it predicts the letter and so on word with some probability.</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.nithinrajs.in/ocr-using-artificial-neural-network-opencv-part-1/">Reference</a></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">In case of histogram analysis, histograms are calculated in both horizontal and vertical directions. Then they are compared with sample letters' histograms and predict the letter. Histograms are the indicator of spatial distribution of number of pixels for some pixel value. Since we are using binary image, it will give only two numbers for each column of pixels. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">4. <strong>Text to speech:-</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 60px;">After text recognition, the text in image is stored in a text file. Since, our bot will be reading line by line, we used some processing on text file in order to read properly. We used shell code to extract only top line from text file and read it. We used software festival, to read the top line extracted.</p><p style="margin-left: 60px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 60px;"> </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><b style="font-size: 14px;">AVR/Atmega Coding:-</b></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1.

So the angualar resolution is also increased i.e. it becomes double the angular resolution in full mode. Also in half mode sequence the number of steps gets doubled as that of full mode. Half mode is usually preffered over full mode.

To calculate step angle,simply divide 360 by number of steps a motor takes to complete one revolution. As we have seen that in half mode, the number of steps taken by the motor to complete one revolution gets doubled, so step angle reduces to half.<br><br><br>As in above examples, Stepper Motor rotating in full mode takes 4 steps to complete a revolution, So step angle can be calculated as...<br><br>Step Angle ø = 360° / 4 = 90°<br><br>and in case of half mode step angle gets half so 45°.<br><br>So this way we can calculate step angle for any stepper motor. Usually step angle is given in the spec sheet of the stepper motor you are using. Knowing stepper motor's step angle helps you calibrate the rotation of motor also to helps you move the motor to correct angular position.</p><p>REMEMBER: The logic 1 which indicates flow of current through the coil should be replaced by 0 in the code as that'll allow the current to flow through the respective coil.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"></p>
