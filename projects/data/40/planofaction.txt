<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li><strong>Planned</strong></li><li>To learn basics of image processing, OpenCV and solid works.</li><li> To acquire the necessary components forming the mechanical and electrical part of the robot. </li><li> Discussing image processing with mentors and getting acquainted about the knowledge of image processing.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Accomplished</strong><ul><li>Installed OpenCV in ubuntu and worked out basic image processing programs and algorithms. Learnt basic solidworks.</li><li>Learnt about basic aspects of text recognition.</li><li>Purchased various components required for mechanical structure of bot.</li><li>Learnt about basic AVR programs like glowing an LED.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li><strong>Planned</strong></li><li>Implementing and testing the basics of image processing using webcam.</li><li>Designing the mechanical structure of robot using Solidworks.</li><li>Detecting letters and digits in the image.</li><li><strong>What you have accomplishe</strong>d?<ul><li>Prepared code for text detection by using binary images, filters and contour detection. Learnt about neural network in order to recognize text from image.</li><li>Worked out AVR code to glow LED and to run stepper motor.</li><li>Designed the bot using solidworks.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?:</li><li>Recognizing text from an image and from webcam.</li><li> Constructing circuit to convert extracted letters and digits into speech.</li></ul><ul><li>What we achieved ?:</li><li>Tried to construct mechanical structure using conveyor belts and pulleys. </li><li>Used AVR code to run the stepper motor to drive conveyor belt.</li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li><li>Assembling the bot and making it pronounce the recorded text using text
to speech module.</li><li>Extending its ability to read short words and numbers..</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li><li>Changed mechanical structure of robot by using rack and pinion for horizontal motion and screw and nut for vertical motion.</li><li>Modified image processing code so that it will read only the top line in the image.</li></ul><p>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</p><ul><li>What you have planned ?</li><li>Completing the mechanism of bot and giving finishing 
touches to the bot
.</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished?</li><li>Had some problems with change in signature of atmega16. Due to it, there were problems in feeding the code to the atmega.</li><li>Modified image processing code such that it captures three images and join them to get a continuous line to avoid reading problems.</li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul><li>What you have planned ?:</li><li>Final testing the bot for all 
types of words and sentences
.</li></ul><ul><li>What you have accomplished? : </li><li>Removed the error due to signature by repairing some connections. </li><li>Added translating command in ubuntu terminal that uses Google Translate.</li><li>Removed further errors in reading of robot. This made it able to translate to more accuracy.</li></ul>
