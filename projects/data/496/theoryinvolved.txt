<div>the basic aim of our project is to transfer electrical energy wirelessly across two coils. for this we use the concept of mutual induction.</div><ul><li>resonating inductive coupling:</li></ul><p><strong>resonance  </strong> : Non-resonant coupled inductors work on the principle of a primary coil generating a magnetic field and a secondary coil subtending as much as possible of that field/magnetic-flux so that the power passing through the secondary is as close as possible to that of the primary. as the distance between the coils increases, the amount of flux coverd by the secondary coil decreases drastically. unless the distance between the coils is very less, non-resonant coupling is highly insignificant. </p><p>using resonance increases the efficiency. by using suitable combination capacitors, an oscillating circuit can be created. by tuning both the coils to same frequency, we can increase the efficiency so that there is significant power transmission over a distance of few coil-diameters.</p><ul>
<li>Q-factor:</li></ul><p>the oscillating current in the primary coil will produce oscillating magnetic field which induces current in the secondary coil. however, this oscillation will die away at a rate determined by the gain-bandwidth (Q factor), mainly due to resistive and radiative losses. However, provided the secondary coil cuts enough of the field that it absorbs more energy than is lost in each cycle of the primary, then most of the energy can still be transferred. </p><p>while large Q factor ensures that the loss of power is minimum in the primary coil circuit, care should be taken to minimise the loss of power in other parts of the circuit. </p><ul>
<li>magnetic core: the amount of flux through a material depends on the permeability of the material. for a given magnetic field, greater the permeability, greater is the flux</li></ul>
