<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul><li>Planned<ul><li>create the basic circuit diagram for testing the theory.<br></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>accomplished<ul><li>gone through various patents on wireless power transmission.</li><li>tested electrodynamic induction theory.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 2 (May 12th- 18th )</h3><ul><li>Planned                               </li><li> Build Colpitts' oscillator circuit </li><li>What you have accomplished?<ul><li>We built colpitts oscillator circuit on bread board using different values of capacitances and inductors, but the oscillator is giving dc output.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul><li>Planned
<ul><li>Modify Colpitts' oscillator by using Op-amp instead of transistor.</li><li>Try Hartley Oscillator</li><li>Use wein bridge oscillator as last choice</li><li>Use readymade Crystal oscillator</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>What we achieved<ul><li>Unsuccessful attempt at achieving AC voltage with both modified Colpitts' oscillator and Hartley oscillator.</li><li>Failure of wein bridge oscillator.  Selection of Crystal oscillator on suggestion of RAHUL PRAJAPAT. His opinion is that failure of hand made oscillators is due to errors in analog circuit elements and high precision circuit elements must be used.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul><li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Make Primary and Secondary coils</li><li>Use rectifier and smoothener for production of approximately DC voltage from AC source and feed it to oscillator.</li><li>Use OP-AMP for amplification of output voltage from oscillator.</li></ul></li><li>achievements
<ul>
<li>debate over selection of hand made or readymade coils. Hand made coils is final choice.</li><li>OP AMP being non-ideal is causing problems to the point of no amplification. We read theory online to find ways to get the op-amp to work near ideally but no success.OP AMP is being replaced by voltage multiplier.As voltage multiplier is being used we have dropped the rectifier also.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul><li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Use Voltage multiplier in primary and secondary circuits to increase voltage.</li><li>Increase the no. of turns of secondary coil to increase voltage induced.</li><li>Completion of Project.</li><li>Soldering all components on PCB.</li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>Voltage multiplier consisted of two Zener Diodes and two capacitors Initially. On mentor's suggestion only one zener diode and one capacitor will be used.</li><li>Voltage multiplier is showing zero output . Maybe the CRO is faulty. We reverted back to using a rectifier but the functioning of the rectifier is not proper.We will test the voltage multiplier again on another CRO.</li><li>Secondary coil has 34 turns. Primary coil has 16 turns.</li><li>We soldered all components on two PCBs. But electrical connection was not established. There is a fault in the way the connections have been made.We have removed some components from primary circuit board and will solder them again.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 6 (June 9th - June 15th)</h3><ul><li>Project is completed.</li></ul>
