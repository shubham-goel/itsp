<h3><strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Write how you achieved to your project in detail</span></strong> :</h3><pre><br></pre><p>The project is purely a electronics project.</p><p>Electronics Approach</p><p>The project has two parts: Primary Circuit and Secondary Circuit.</p><p>Primary Circuit Consists Of a Step Down Transformer,Crystal Oscillator, Voltage multiplier and Primary Coil.</p><p>AC Voltage is step down from 230V to 12V. It is amplified and at the same time convertede to DC voltage by voltage multiplier.The DC Voltage is converted to 4 MHz AC by oscillator and fed to the primary coil.</p><p>Secondary Circuit consists of Secondary coil, voltage multiplier and output load.</p><p>The voltage multiplier converts 4 mhz AC to DC for Battery charging.</p><p>Flux created by Primary coil cuts Secondary coil and induces emf in secondary circuit which will be used to charge a battery.</p>
