As extension to our project 
The model which we have used is basically developed for four basic commands but it can be 
extended to many more systems. It is a robust model which can be used for even more than 
100 words which sound dissimilar. And using this we can build A voice controlled home, Tvs , 
washing machines etc all controlled by voices. Imagine How good it will be. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
