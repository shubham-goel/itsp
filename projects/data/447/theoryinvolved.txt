<li>PRODUCTION OF LIFT AND THRUST BY THE WING:</li></ul><p>Wing has the shape of semi-ellipse.(recognized design)</p><p>The wing has two visible divisions .One of them triangular and the other making up the remaining part.</p><p>LIFT:</p><p>while flapping ,triangular portion moves up and down i.e responsible for forces in the vertical direction which is lift.</p><p>THRUST:</p><p>the no triangular part is partially dependent on the triangular part so while flapping its motion is inclined to the vertical plane so it's motion give the thrust.</p><p>CONTROL SURFACES:(tail)</p><p>Once we got he required thrust and lift we need to be able to change the pitch and yaw of the ornithopter.Tail does this job.</p><p>it is controlled by two servos and the mechanism is similar to aeroplane's elevator and rudder.</p><p>USE OF GEARS:</p><p>to help move the wings in flapping motion high reduction ratio is useful as the motor can't provide such high torques.</p><p>AERODYNAMICS:</p><p>We didn't actually understand the actual aerodynamics but referred to some researc papes,articles and videos.</p><p>we decided the dimensions of wings ,flapping frequency etc from some of the research papers which gave the emperical relations between the weight of the ornithopter and wingspan frequency ,area of the wings.</p>
