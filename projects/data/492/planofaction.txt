<h3>Week 1 (May 5th -11th)</h3><ul>
<li>Planned
<ul>
<li>Learn
image processing and ensure precise gesture recognition from webcam.</li><li><ins>Buy all the
electronic components require for the project.</ins></li><li><p><img src="http://www.stab-iitb.org/resources/images/f/f7/Logical_structure.png" style="width: 513px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" alt=""></p></li></ul></li></ul><ul>

<ul>
<li><ins>learn the working of
IR sensors as to how will collision be avoided using them.</ins></li></ul></li><li>What you have accomplished?
<ul>
<li>could not learn it due to some unforeseen reasons but continued working on image processing.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 3 (May 19th - 25th)</h3><ul>

<ul>
<li>Build <ins>the skeletal
structure of the </ins><del>a </del>car <ins>i.e.
the chassis along </ins>with <ins>the motors and the
wheels.</ins></li><li><ins>Also, in this

<li>What we achieved
<ul>
<li>Completed all that was decided</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Week 4 (May 26th - June 1)</h3><ul>
<li>Code the chip and map <ins>different
hand gestures to the outputs to be produced by the car.</ins></li><li><ins>Also, add</ins> the <ins>IR/Ultrasonic </ins>sensors <ins>whichever
may seem appropriat to the whees </ins>.</li></ul><ul>
<li>What you have accomplished?</li></ul><p>Found out a much better way of getting the centres of the LED's and differentiating them. Very good results from the testing. Recognised the problems. Working on solving them</p><h3>Week 5 (June 2nd - June 8th)</h3><ul>
