		The project looked a bit daunting at first but we launched a two pronged assault on the Coding and Electronic fronts.</p><h3>Web/Coding Approach</h3><p>
	We puzzled over the problem of retrieving the required status, with all the security that Facebook now has, given it's privacy settings. In the end, we decided to go ahead and use the Facebook API, which made this infinitely easier. This app was used to enable a secure login to Hats-Off through Facebook.
