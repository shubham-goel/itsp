<h3><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Note:our project was initially follower
umbrella which we had to change because of its high cost and no proper
mechanism for obstacle detection.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
1:Met the mentor and discussed our project with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  Also
learnt solid works properly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
2:Discussed 
various possible designs and finalised design for making it fly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  We
had decided to make it fly using Quadcopter and hence we searched about
quadcopter and studied how to build it.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
3:Discussed with mentor about quadcopter and went to
purchase the components.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  Those
components which did not yet include stuff to be used for Obstacle detection
costed around Rs.13500 which was very costly and hence decide to change the
p[roject on mentorâ€™s advice and finally decided to make a robotic sweeper.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
4:Discussed about the deisgn for robotic sweeper and
its mechanism for obstacle detection.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  Finalised
the design and push button switches for obstacle detection.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  Bought
The components and began building the robotic sweeper</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
5:Wrote the algorithm for the code.  </span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  Did
30% of both mechanical and electrical work</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Week
6:wrote the final code for bot.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">  It
being the last week we had to complete the bot which we did at the eleventh
hour.</span></p></h3>
