They also allow us the bot to move in two mutually perpendicular directions without having to trace a curve.</li><li>Removable dustbins using magnets help handling of trash</li><li>Cylindrical brooms help continuous sweeping.</li><li>Push button switches act as wall and obstacle sensors. Since these are mechanical switches, they reduce errors found in other types of electronic sensors. Different value resistances attached to each switch help to differentiate between wall and obstacle.</li></ul><p></p>
