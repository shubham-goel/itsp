So is the case with ours. The world of today is seeing an increased dependence on machines for the implementation of the most trivial tasks. So is the case with us. Taking this thought to the next level was the motive. P.S : It also turns out to be a good summer pass time and an excellent opportunity to learn organisational and leadership skills!</p><p style="margin-left: 360px;"><img src="http://ksfinblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/innovative-business-ideas.jpg" style="width: 180px;" title="" alt="undefined"></p><p>Our model is some what similar to a vending machine seen in several foreign countries (Lets hope we soon get to see it in India under Modi Sarkar!). However as the name suggests the motive is to replace the existing systems of manually serving drinks food stuff etc. in flights. Our model is a prototype but can be further extended to a more sophisticated and a better automated version of the same. The future modifications also include a personal ATM which is to act both as a safe as well as an automated reservoir for money allowing the user to take out the required amount by means of the touchscreen.</p>
