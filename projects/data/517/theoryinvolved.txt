<ul><li>Deciding the mechanism to move the components to the delivery system was the most daunting task. This was achieved by making use of U shaped aluminium strips on which rack was mounted. The corresponding gears were attached to the car.</li><li>Pulleys were used for the delivery system which are kept on the top of the side walls  of the device.</li><li>Coding and number box were used to convey information from the user to the system. </li><li>Electrical Components Involved:
<ul>
<li>Arduino acts as the processing unit of the system. It is connected to the number box, L293D and 7805.</li><li>7805 IC-Voltage Regulator- Takes input voltage of 7-35 V and gives a fixed output of 5 V. </li><li>Heat Sink used for 7805.</li><li>L293D IC used for controlling motors using arduino. </li><li>L293D and 7805 pin info:<ul>
<li>Pin no.s 2,7,10,15 connected to arduino  respectively.</li><li>3,6,11,14 are connected to motors.</li><li>4,5,12,13 are grounded by connecting them to grounded pins of 7805.</li><li>8 is connected to input voltage of 7805.</li><li>1,9,16 is connected to output pin of 7805.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Coding functions involved: Digitalwrite functions are used to make the following functions work. For exact code snippets please refer to the coding section.<br><ul><li>motorForward-makes the motor move forward.</li><li>motorStop-makes the motor stop.</li><li>motorBackward-makes the motor move backward.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
