<p><strong>Wanted to make a demonstrative project on basic science.</strong></p><p><strong>Scope of the model is to be modified to detect products of various radioactive decays,pair production,etc.</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><iframe replaced="true" s3055857632596092664="true" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ReN2l816L8k" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="415" width="660"></iframe><p>Possible Uses of Voice recognition 
As extension to our project 
The model which we have used is basically developed for four basic commands but it can be 
extended to many more systems. It is a robust model which can be used for even more than 
100 words which sound dissimilar. And using this we can build A voice controlled home, Tvs , 
washing machines etc all controlled by voices. Imagine How good it will be. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p>
