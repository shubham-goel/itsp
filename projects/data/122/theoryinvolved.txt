<p>1) IMAGE PROCESSING</p><p>           the first thing we have to do inthis project is that we have to identify the object based on the colour.This done by thresholding the image by generating trackbars</p><p>After thresholding it the image i given to the canny thresh function which draws contours along all the objects detected. It then calculates the co ordinates of the objects.</p><p>2)BOT</p><p>       The bot is a simple.it only contains two extra objects which directs  the bot to go in the specific direction</p>
