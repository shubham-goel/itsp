<p>The project
consists of real time, 2D tracking of the planeâ€™s latitude and longitude on
Gymkhana grounds. The plane used
is an RC scale model of the Extra 300 plane, made of
balsa wood, and carries the multiple GPS modules. It uses high
performance components to test the tracking potentials of the plane
in both the dimensions.</p>
