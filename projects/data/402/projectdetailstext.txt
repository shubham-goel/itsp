<h3>The Plane</h3><p>We started the project with the construction of the RC plane, which was essential. After acquiring the materials and the scaled-down plan for Extra-300, we started constructing the structure of the plane using balsa wood. Thereafter the assembly of the structure was completed. We used covering film to cover the wings, while for the fuselage we used papier-mache, which was painted over using spray paint. </p><iframe width="500" height="300" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/E0AYdtG4ezQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h3>GPS and coding</h3><p>For the GPS part of the project, we used an Arduino inside the plane which was connected to a XBee to transmit the GPS location to a laptop. We are making use of the open-source code of Google Earth to track the plane in real time.</p>
