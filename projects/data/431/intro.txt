<p>In this generation we are witnessing a huge demand for robotics and it has become an indus-<br>try with a huge potential in engineering and related applications. Huge amount of research is going<br>on to create robots similar to human, which closely mimic human movements and locomotion.<br>Hence our project is a stepping stone into this world. Currently we would use this to create sketches<br>but the same design can be modified to render it useful for a plethora of other jobs.</p><p>In our project we create a robotic arm to make sketches. The arm will move in a plane and will be made of 2 members.<br>It will have 2 degrees of freedom, one for rotation of ' shoulder ' and the other for rotation ofcapture th<br>â€˜elbow'. Moreover in the ' wrist ' we will attach  a small servo for pen up- down motion.</p><p>OpenCV is being used to capture the contours, approximate it into a set of straight line and to define a shading pattern.</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/10155858_775603745785905_954071363_n.png"></p>
