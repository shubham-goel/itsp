<p>CODING APPROACH</p><p>We are using OpenCV to process the image provided. User can either make a portrait of themselves or use a previoulsy saved image. The program shows the detected face to the user so that  they can select a suitable position. Then after confirmation, face is detected, and a region of interest is cropped which is then further processed. This image is blurred with suiatable parameters and then Canny is used to extract the edges. Further we find out the conutours from the edges. Then each contour is approximated into a polygonal curve and the vertices are stored in a vector. Moreover unnecessary contours, such as those which are too small to be relevant and those which are too far away from the image centre are rejected.</p><p>For shading, we are implementing a 2 level shading scheme. Different shading levels are distinguished by using hatched patterns kept at different separation. Then a procedure similar to the previous one is done to find out the sketch to be drawn.</p><p>For moving the arm to draw the picture, we used Arduino Programming. We use an Arduino UNO board and an associated SD card shield. All the coordinates provided by OpenCV is stored in an SD card and we access the contents of the SD card using Arduino interface. To move the arm to desired coordinates, we use inverse kinematics to find how much each arm has to be rotated to get the pen to the coordinates.Each part of the arm is 20cm long. So from inverse kinematics, we figure out the angle that each part needs to rotate. Then we use servos that are controlled by arduino to rotate the arm. There is a third servo which controls the actions, "PEN UP" and "PEN DOWN". This is also controlled by the arduino. Pen up action occurs when there is an end of a contour. Pen down occurs at beginning of a contour.</p>
