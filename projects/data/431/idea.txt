We will be taking pictures with a webcam. Users will be able given the option to either draw a portrait of themselves or just upload any image for sketching. In case of portraits, we detect the face from the video and the user has to select a pleasing frame from the video which he/she wants to be sketched. 
</strong></p><p><strong>This frame is processed to yield the contours, and the approximate set of straight lines representing the contours  subsequently. Further 'unnecessary' lines are rejected which may make the sketch cluttered. This is a good point for research for developing effective procedures and algorithms for achieving the above mentioned task. Moreover regions for shading is identified using a series of thresholding operations. Unnecessary noise is removed by a series of morphological operations which can be controlled by the user.  2 types of regions are identified. 1 for light and other for dark shading. These are achieved by hatching the region with parallel lines and varying the gaps between them. <br></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Finally the coordinates of the end points of the straight lines are kept in a text file, which would be sent to the microcontroller by interfacing with an SD card using a SD card shield for arduino.<br></strong></p>
